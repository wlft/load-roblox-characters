# load-roblox-characters

directory does not contain any required models such as UI and will error when run. However, every script file is available. Full plugin (including UI, events, & models) are available in .rbxm, .rbxmx, .rbxl & .rbxlx. The .rbxm & .rbxmx are ready for install/use.

TL;DR please use the .rbxmx file and save it as a local plugin to use the plugin locally or view its full source
